title: To-Do
---

PySAT toolkit is a work in progress. Although it can already be helpful in
many practical settings (and it **was** successfully applied by its authors
for a number of times), it would be great if some of the following additional
features were implemented:

-   more SAT solvers to support (e.g.
    [RISS](http://tools.computational-logic.org/content/riss.php), [Intel (R)
    SAT Solver](https://github.com/alexander-nadel/intel_sat_solver) among
    many others)
-   lower level access to some of the solvers\' internal parameters (e.g.
    *variable activities*, etc.)

These will require a significant effort to be made. Therefore, we would like
to encourage the SAT community to contribute and make PySAT a tool for an easy
and comfortable day-to-day use. :)
